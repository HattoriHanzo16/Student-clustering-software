# Student-clustering-software

I Decided to think of a situation,where school or university has to divide students into
groups,accordingly to their GPA and ECA points,but sometimes they may need 2,3,4 or
even cluster of the whole students,so i decided to create a system,where all the students
could have been clustered respectively to their GPA and ECA points.

# USAGE

    which is provided as a csv file in the folder
